# CPE 517 - Digital and Computer Systems Architecture
### Lab: MIPS Simulator
The goal of this assignment is to understand how MIPS datapath is designed and performed. To achieve 
this, you will write a cycle-accurate instruction-level simulator that supports a subset of the MIPS 
ISA. This instruction-level simulator will model the behavior of each instruction and will allow the user 
to run MIPS programs and see their outputs.
